# MCAE QUB Dataset
This dataset contains 20,000 image patch triplets of colorectal tissue originally derived from The Cancer Imaging Archive (project: TCGA COAD). 

Each triplet in the dataset represents the same tissue specimen but with the appearance of different staining and scanning protocols. These derived imagers were produced using a CycleGAN and therefore this dataset is partially synthetic.
